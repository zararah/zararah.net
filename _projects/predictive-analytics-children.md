description: Research on the ethical impacts of predictive analytics on children

---

Together with Julia Keseru, and as part of a research project while I was at The Engine Room, I co-wrote a paper for [UNICEF](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/1275-predictive-analytics-for-children-an-assessment-of-ethical-considerations-risks-and-benefits.html) examining the potential ethical issues associated with predictive analytics as they pertain to children. We produced a long paper, and [a shorter brief](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/1273-predictive-analytics-for-children-an-assessment-of-ethical-considerations-risks-and-benefits.html) which summarises the main points.

I was amazed while working on this research how widespread predictive analytics already is; and second, how the term 'predictive analytics' (though relatively widely used in some industries) remains somewhat blurry. We tried in this paper to come up with a definition and a taxonomy to help assess and understand the impacts, looking at individual-focused predictive analytics, and population-level predictive analytics.
